The behaviour of the create ticket API is strongly linked to the application type selected for your application key. 
Based on the application type, the validation and value required in the payload may vary. 
The examples provided in the next topics are specific to an application of the type "Partner".

A ticket has 2 employees
- The requester
- The affected employee

The ticket is always created in the company of the affected employee.

If at ticket creation you only specify requester or affected employee, the API is considering them as being equal.

The company of the requester and the affected employee can be different but must always be under the same organisation/customer.

Having a different requester and affected employee is useful in the scenario where a manager is requesting something for an employee. 
Note that the relationship between the employee and the requester is never validated by the API, the caller should verify this relationship in the HRIS system.
At ticket creation, the API also offers you the possibility to directly attach one or more files to the ticket.
The binary should be encoded as a Base64 string. (see RFC 2045). http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045
